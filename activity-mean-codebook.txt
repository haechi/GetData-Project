Subject Activity Mean 
=====================

Description
-----------

The features presented in this database originates form the UCI HAR Dataset and represent a tidy data subset of the original data set. 

The dataset is organized by subject, with 30 unique subjects. Measurements are summarized by labels, which contain the activities of the test subjects.

For each subject and activity mean of all the selected corresponding observation has been calculated. 

Format
------

Two descriptive columns, structuring the data set:

subject - id between 1 and 30
label - character string containing the activity (lowercase)  

The selected signal observations are:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals as floats in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Two set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
